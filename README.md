## Motivation and Problem Definition
- We define good games as those with scores above the Q3 quantile of the rating among all games on [Steam Database](https://steamdb.info/).

- Can we predict a game as good/bad game just by its attributes?

- Which model is the best?

- When players evaluate a good/bad game, what words do they use?

## Models Used
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Naive Bayes

## Conclusion
