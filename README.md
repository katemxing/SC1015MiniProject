This is a Mini-Project for SC1015 Introduction to Data Science and Artificial Intelligence.

It focuses on the analysis of [Steam Store Games (Clean dataset)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nikdavis/steam-store-games.) scraped from Steam and SteamSpy APIs by Nik Davis on Kaggle.

## Motivation and Problem Definition

- We define good games as those with scores above the Q3 quantile of the rating among all games on [Steam Database](https://steamdb.info/).

- Can we predict a game as good/bad game just by its attributes?

- Which model is the best for abovementioned classification?

- When players evaluate a good/bad game, what words do they use?

## Models Used

- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Sentiment Analysis
- Naive Bayes
